## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## How to use our app
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JinTao0813/kitahack_budget_gang.git
cd kitahack_budget_gang
  
In Google Colab notebook:
- Remember to change your runtime to python3 and using online GPU
- The public images that collected from online: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayuraj/asl-dataset
- Roboflow annotated public dataset:  https://app.roboflow.com/cecilia-ggvz6/asldetection-o5fgv/2
  
For Flutter:
- The tensorflow model that you are going integrate will be "best_float32.tflite" that was being located in (google_colab_file/best_saved_model (1)/content/runs/detect/train/weights/best_saved_model/best_float32.tflite) folder.
- Please use this to import the tflite flutter so only can use the model inside
  
```bash
import 'package:tflite_flutter/tflite_flutter.dart';
