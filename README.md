## üì±About
---

#### SeeSpeak is an AI-powered Flutter app that bridges communication for the visually and hearing impaired.  
It leverages real-time hand gesture recognition(YOLOv8 which then further converted to TFLite), and Gemini API for speech/sign conversion.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK version 3.29.2
- Dart 3.7.2
- IDE (VS Code)
- AI training : Google Colab, Yolov8
- Image annotation: Roboflow

## How to use our app
1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JinTao0813/kitahack_budget_gang.git
```
```bash
cd kitahack_budget_gang
```
2. Install Dependencies
```bash
  flutter pub get
```
```bash
  flutter gen-l10n
```
3. Run the app
```bash
  flutter run
  or optionally you can run flutter run --release
```
## Google Colab notebook for training AI model:
- Remember to change your runtime to python3 and using online GPU
- The public images that collected from online: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayuraj/asl-dataset
- Roboflow annotated public dataset:  https://app.roboflow.com/cecilia-ggvz6/asldetection-o5fgv/2
## To see the full code on how to run:

```bash
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15D9tFl1uxaIz92AXmjFSEZ5uxraCB9qn?usp=sharing
```
After everything run finished and you got the zip folder, for us we placed it under the google_colab_file

For Flutter:
- The tensorflow model that you are going integrate will be "best_float32.tflite" that was being located in (google_colab_file/best_saved_model (1)/content/runs/detect/train/weights/best_saved_model/best_float32.tflite) folder.
- Please use this to import the tflite flutter so only can use the model inside
  
```bash
import 'package:tflite_flutter/tflite_flutter.dart';
```
After these, you will need a USB cable to connect your Android phone 
* You have to check this side by clicking it (in your VSCODE right hand side lower corner)

* It will then prompt out this thing

* Please select the device you are going to run the app
* flutter run // optional, you can run in flutter run --release

## üéâOutcomes
(Mine is old phone with old screen protector and that's why you see the linings, so no worries! The app itself is fine!)
